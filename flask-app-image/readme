This is a basic Docker project where you'll learn to create you own custom image or your application image and will push it to docker hub (repository):

Steps :
1. Create your flask app 
2. create a requirements.txt with all the requiremets/dependecy that will be needed to run this app
3. Create a Dockerfile (Please refer the flask-app-image/Dockerfile section)

*/***********************************/*
4. Now build the docker image of your application by running the command 
  CMD ->  " docker build -t flask-app-image . "
  here -t refers to the tag/name of your image 
5. Now you can run the container of this image by running any one command mentioned below

" Docker run -d -p 3000:3000 flask-app-image "  OR " Docker container run -d -p 3000:3000 flask-app-image "

Here -d : refers to container running in detach/background mode
     -p : refers to portmapping which is required to access the application externally
