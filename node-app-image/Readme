This is a basic Docker project where you'll learn to create you own custom image or your node-application image and will push it to docker hub (repository):

Steps :
1. Create your simple node app 

2. In the packgae.json add the below script to start our app 

    "scripts": {
      "start": "node index.js"
     },
     
3. Now create a Dockerfile with required configuration (Please refer the my-node-app/Dockerfile section)

4. Once dockerfile is created, build the docker image of your application by running the below command 
  CMD ->  " docker build -t my-node-app . "
  here -t refers to the tag/name of your image 
  
5. Now you can run the container of this image by running any one command mentioned below

" Docker run -d -p 3000:3000 my-node-app "  OR " Docker container run -d -p 3000:3000 my-node-app "

Here -d : refers to container running in detach/background mode
     -p : refers to portmapping which is required to access the application externally
     
 6. You can verify the application running by hitting localhost:3000 in your browser.
 
 7. The final step is to push your docker image to Docker hub repository to make it available public/private.
 
      CMD -->  " docker push your_username/my-node-app
